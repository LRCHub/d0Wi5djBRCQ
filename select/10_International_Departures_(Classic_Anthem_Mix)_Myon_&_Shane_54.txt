Shoot me down and I'll get up again
Emotions running high with double meaning
Just another day to keep it calm within
But I can't find a way to fight this shadow dreaming
We're always waiting for the night
Never lost cause we can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me and we can go where the light shines brightest
Stay all night, runaway all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night
Stay all night, runaway all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night...
Push and shove against the thoughts you left me with
Of, every picture of regret my expectation
Your emotions can't hide behind those eyes
Conversations comes quick to steal me back again
We're always waiting for the night
Never lost cause we can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me and we can go where the light shines brightest
(So come with me)
Stay all night, runaway all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night
Stay all night, runaway all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night...
