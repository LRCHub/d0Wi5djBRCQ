You've cast these scars across my face
You can't bring me down
You think I'll never be the same
And i don't know what's wrong with me
I wanted to be all the things you need
All the things you need
And now I'm standing here alone
I'm waiting for it all to come and go
All to come and go
Maybe I just have to let it go
Make it up, Make it up
when you're not around
Break it up, Break it up
can't you hear the sound of the sun
rising from the ground
Make it up, Make it up
when you're not around
Break it up, Break it up
Do you always want to be the one
running from yourself
And nothing's ever as it seems
When all your dreams exist in memories
exist in memories
And all the trama takes it's toll
I dont' remember all our common goals
All our common goals
Maybe you just have to let me know
It's not you I'm afraid of
But I'm not scared of myself
You'll lie with or without me
You'll never need my help
